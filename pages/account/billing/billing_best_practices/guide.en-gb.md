## Objective

This guide will give you all the tips to manage properly your account and the billing of your OVHcloud services.

**This guide explains how to set your OVHcloud services/account in order to prevent any interruption or irregularity.**

## Requirements

- having access to your control panel
- possessing active OVHcloud services

## Instructions

### Account settings

#### Personal informations

As a customer, you want to have an account which is up to date in terms of personal datas. It is necessary for security and for the good functionning of your services.

To check your personal details, click on your name at the top right of your screen, on your initials (`Manage my account`{.action}), then click on `...`{.action} in `My profile`{.action} section. To know more about this, consult the guide [Securing my OVHcloud account and managing my personal information](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/all-about-your-username/#how-to-manage-your-personal-details_1).

Ensure your e-mail address is always up to date and secured. You must have access to it as OVHcloud will send you informations and notices about your account and services. Add a back-up e-mail in case to prevent loose of access to the main one.

Note that e-mails sent by OVH will be also visible in your [OVHcloud control panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/fr/&ovhSubsidiary=fr), in `Service emails`{.action} section.

#### Payment method

In order to prevent any service interruption, and for the good functionning of the autorenewal, we recommend that you [register a payment method](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/billing/manage-payment-methods/) in your [OVHcloud control panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/fr/&ovhSubsidiary=fr).

#### Account Security

We strongly advise you [to create a strong password](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/manage-password/#generate-a-strong-password) which will ensure your account privacy. You can also reinforce security by choosing to [Enable two factor authentification](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/secure-account-with-2FA/) to prevent any fraudulent access.

For the security measures to be efficient, make sure your e-mail addresses (main and back-up) and your mobile number are up-to-date and accessible.

### Order follow-up

Did you know that you can track your orders in your [OVHcloud control panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/fr/&ovhSubsidiary=fr) ? Just navigate to the `Dashboard`{.action}, then click on `View my orders`{.action}. 

You will find out the steps of delivery and you will know if actions are required from your side.

### Renewal of OVHcloud services

In order to prevent any service interruption, OVHcloud recommends you to activate automatic renewal (autorenew) on your services. Your invoices will then automatically be paid with your default payment.

If you don't [register a payment method](), you will receive notifications, inviting you to perform a manual payment to either renew your service in advance, or regularize your pending invoice.

### Termination

#### Service termination

When you do not need your service anymore, just set the termination before the renewal date in your control panel.

#### Account closure

If you do not need your account anymore, Please make sure you do not have active services anymore. Then, you ask for deletion from the GDPR form.
