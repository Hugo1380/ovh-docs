## Objective

Office 365 for Resellers (CSP2) is a service that allows you to get different types of Microsoft 365 licences at discounted prices so you can resell them to your customers.

**This guide explains how to subscribe to and manage an Office 365 Reseller (CSP2) service from OVHcloud.**

## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)

## Instructions

### Order an Office 365 Reseller service

To order an Office 365 Resellers service, go to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB). Once you have logged in, select `Sunrise`{.action} in the top menu, then click on `Office 365 Revendeurs`{.action}.

- Enter the contact information for your end customer. This information is requested to define the manager for the licence group ("Tenant") you are going to create.

> [!primary]
>
> - If you already have an Office 365 CSP2 service with Microsoft, you can delegate the administration to OVHcloud. You will be able to add additional subscriptions directly via the OVHcloud Control Panel. When you order a new group of licences, select `Delegation of a platform previously created with Microsoft `{.action} as the type of order.
>
> - If you have a Microsoft Partner ID, you can enter it in this interface. This will enable you to obtain cashback on the subscriptions you order via our Control Panel. This cashback is subject to the rules defined by Microsoft for the number of subscriptions you generate.
>

- In the list below, specify the licences you want to add to your group.

- Click `Order`{.action} to complete your order.

> [!warning]
>
> Please ensure that the email address entered when you create your licence group is valid, as it will receive the credentials for the Microsoft platform.

### Manage your Office 365 Reseller service

Once the Office 365 service has been created, it will be available to manage in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}.

To do this, go to the `Sunrise`{.action} section. In the left-hand menu, choose `Office 365 Revendeurs`{.action}, then select the service.

The following information appears:

- **Internal service name**: indicates the name of your service. You can only see this in your Control Panel.
- **Service display name**: allows you to customise the display name of the service in your Control Panel.
- **Created**: indicates when the service was created.
- **Microsoft administrative Portal**: provides access to the Office portal that allows you to manage your subscriptions.
- **Reset the admin password**: allows you to change the password for logging in to the Microsoft administration portal.

### Automatically configure a domain name registered at OVHcloud

OVHcloud provides a tool that makes it easy to configure your domain name's DNS zone. You can automatically configure your domain names using the OVHcloud DNS zone, so that they can work with the following solutions:

- Exchange Online
- Skype;
- Intune.

To do this, select the domain in question from the drop-down list, and then select the appropriate solutions. The necessary DNS records will then be added in the domain's DNS zone at OVHcloud.

> [!warning]
> For the configuration to work, you need to ensure that you are using the OVHcloud DNS servers for the domain names concerned. Please refer to our guide on [Modifying DNS servers for an OVHcloud domain name](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/domains/web_hosting_general_information_about_dns_servers/).

### Manage your subscriptions

By managing your subscriptions, you can increase or cancel licences associated with your subscription group. A table allows you to view the details:

- **ID**: each type of licence ordered has a unique identifier (ID).
- **Status**: is the status of your licence.
- **Licence name**: indicates the type of licence you have subscribed.
- **Number of licences**: indicates the number of available licences.
- **Creation date**: indicates when the subscription to the selected licence type was created.
- **Last update**: indicates when the subscription was last updated (such as adding a licence).

Use the `pencil icon` to change the total number of licences in the subscription. The `trash can icon` allows you to cancel the subscription and all of its licences.
